Knowing how to hack also means that when you have ideas, you’ll be able to implement them… It’s a big advantage, when you’re considering an idea like putting a college facebook online, if instead of merely thinking “That’s an interesting idea,” you can think instead “That’s an interesting idea. I’ll try building an initial version tonight.”
- Paul Graham
